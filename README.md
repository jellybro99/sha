# sha

This is a go implementation of SHA-256, as well as a CLI to use it.

Based on the NIST specification: <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf>

## Setup

- Clone the repo and cd into it: `cd sha`
- Install go if you don't have it already <https://go.dev/doc/install>
- Run `go build`, this creates the main executable.
- You can also run without building by using `go run . <arguments>`
